# ConsoleDesign
This is the console designing project (demo) of AirMaster.

What's this?
========
We can find that our game studio has started a project, this project is for making a game about the airline(air company) and the airplane making management.
This project is the child project of the product Air Master.It's a background management and control application based on C++,and we finally plan to realize this console in Java in a same logic and algorithm.

Is it complete?
========
No,this just is a demo application.Even you can think it's just my classwork. :(

(And this is depending on Debug mode --)
